# BurgerDAO
BurgerDAO is an experimental burger stand operating with assistance from the Internet.
Our goal is to livestream a cookout, interacting with people from all over the world, while making delicious burgers.
Patrons will have an opportunity to join the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) to help govern the stand into a legitimate tour de force.
Our aim is to build community through food, whether it's IRL or in the metaverse. We want to provide positive vibes, good times, and education on topics surrounding tech, blockchain, drones, crypto, NFTs, and DAOs.
Join us on this wild adventure.
