# BurgerDAO - The Decentralized Burger Community!
BurgerDAO is a grassroots movement seeking to change the way we come together to enjoy the burger sandwich in all its various, delicious forms. 

Using Web3 technologies, we aim to create a vibrant, global community of burger-lovers, with a strong focus on local community autonomy. 

To do this, we have dreamed up several key concepts that anyone, anywhere, will be able to utilize and contribute to the BurgerDAO framework. We welcome people to contribute their own ideas as we get this show on the road.

We operate under the ideology of good food, good people, & good vibes. For the love of the burgers!

## BurgerDAO Honolulu
The first franchise will be starting up shortly in Honolulu, Hawaii.
Our goal is to livestream cookouts, interact with people from all over the world, and make delicious burgers.
Patrons will have an opportunity to join the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) to help govern the stand into a legitimate tour de force.<br><br>
We operate under the ideology of good food, good people, & good vibes. For the love of the burgers!More to come!
